## App Exercise - Fitness Tracker: Constant or Variable?
 
 >These exercises reinforce Swift concepts in the context of a fitness tracking app.
 
 There are all sorts of things that a fitness tracking app needs to keep track of in order to display the right information to the user. Similar to the last exercise, declare either a constant or a variable for each of the following items, and assign each a sensible value. Be sure to use proper naming conventions.
 
- Name: The user's name
- Age: The user's age
- Number of steps taken today: The number of steps that a user has taken today
- Goal number of steps: The user's goal for number of steps to take each day
- Average heart rate: The user's average heart rate over the last 24 hours
 */
let userName = "Jakob"
print("The name of a person after creating his fitness account remains constant")

var Age = 25
print("A persons age keeps changing over the years")

var stepsTakenToday = 2000
print("The number of steps taken by a person constantly keeps changing during the day")

let stepsGoal = 5000
print("A goal is a fixed outcome the user is expecting to achieve.")

var averageHeartrate = 80
print("The human heart is very versatile and hence it keeps changing dynamically thoughout the day.")

/*:
 Now go back and add a line after each constant or variable declaration. On those lines, print a statement explaining why you chose to declare the piece of information as a constant or variable.
