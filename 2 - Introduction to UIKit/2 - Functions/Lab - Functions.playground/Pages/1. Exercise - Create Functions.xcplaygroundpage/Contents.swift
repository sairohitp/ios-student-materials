## Exercise - Create Functions

 Write a function called `introduceMyself` that prints a brief introduction of yourself. Call the function and observe the printout.

//:  Write a function called `magicEightBall` that generates a random number and then uses either a switch statement or if-else-if statements to print different responses based on the random number generated. `let randomNum = Int.random(in: 0...4)` will generate a random number from 0 to 4, after which you can print different phrases corresponding to the number generated. Call the function multiple times and observe the different printouts.
